sublime-coffeescript-function-finder
================================

This is an adaptation of Tim Douglass's [Find Function Definition](https://github.com/timdouglas/sublime-find-function-definition) to work with CoffeeScript. I don't really know python, so I didn't do much of the work myself.  The check_dirs function which weeds out javascript directories was written by [@BlackDragonHunt](https://github.com/BlackDragonHunt). The regex by [@ACEfanatic02](https://github.com/ACEfanatic02). There could very easily be edge cases this doesn't catch, but for the most part, it should find your function for you. Just HIGHLIGHT the name of a function, press f8 (or set your own keybinding) and the plugin will open the file and take you to the function's definition.
